"""IAB Diligence Platform (SGP) platform client.

Async HTTP client for the IAB Diligence Platform integration API. Currently
exposes a single capability: checking whether a vendor has the IAB
buyer-agent approval flag set on the buyer's SGP tenant.

Endpoint:
    GET /api/v1/integrations/iab/buyer-agent-approval?domain=a.com,b.com

Auth: api-key header, scope `iab:buyerAgent`.
Limit: up to 10 domains per call (SGP-enforced).

    Normalizes domains (strips scheme, www, port, lowercases), dedupes,
    chunks into groups of 10, and caches per-domain results for
    ``cache_ttl_seconds``. Returns a dict keyed by normalized domain; a
    value of ``None`` means the vendor is unknown to SGP (HTTP 404 or
    absent from the batch response).

    Responses are paired back to the queried domain by the ``requestedDomain``
    SGP echoes on each record, so a seller domain that is a subdomain of the
    domain its vendor is registered under still resolves. See the
    "Domain matching" section of docs/integration/iab-diligence-platform.md.

        api_key: SGP API key with ``iab:buyerAgent`` scope.
        base_url: SGP base URL. Defaults to production
            (``https://api.safeguardprivacy.com``). The demo environment
            is at ``https://api.safeguardprivacy-demo.com``.
        timeout: Request timeout in seconds.
        cache_ttl_seconds: How long to cache per-domain results.
        max_retries: Extra attempts for transport errors and the statuses in
            ``_RETRYABLE_STATUS_CODES``. Callers enforcing approval fail
            closed on exhaustion, so a transient blip should not be the same
            event as a definite denial. ``0`` disables retrying.
        retry_backoff_seconds: Base delay, doubled per attempt. ``0`` retries
            immediately (used by tests).

    Can be used as an async context manager, which closes the underlying
    httpx client on exit.
